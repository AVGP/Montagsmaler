Montagsmaler
============

# What this is
Montagsmaler is a HTML5-based clone of games like DrawSomething.
It's played 1 vs. 1 player, one has to visualize a word by drawing and the other has to guess the word.

# What makes it different to the original
This project came to live in early 2012, because I wanted to play with my friend 
while I was on an Android phone and my friend used a computer.

It was a highly frustrating experience - I installed the Android app and we both registered for the game
only to find that you can only play against people in the very same version (so Flash vs. Flash or App vs. App).

That upset me, so I built this cross-platform, no-flash web version.

It is *touchscreen-compatible* and works on your desktop, phone, tablet and even has been tested on the Nintendo 3DS.

In addition you don't have to go thru a lenghty registration process, just play!

# Features

* touchscreen-compatible
* Save your drawings and share them via Facebook
* Facebook integration

# ToDo

* Additional game mode: Play with a friend instead of a random person
* Fully updating to node 0.10
* Refactoring as this evolved from a very crude prototype into something people actually care about
