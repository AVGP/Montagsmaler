This is a prototype for a "Draw something" clone built with node.js, socket.io, jQuery and HTML5.

Status:

* Bug with Android browser: while mousemove, the second event fired is displaced (always to [451, 451])
* Works only if server is restarted for every game
* The "GUI" (I don't even dare to call it this way) is making you freak out by being incredibly ugly!
